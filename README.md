Random's Little Helper
======================

Not really a pirate's little helper clone, but

Local
-----

Analyzes pasted Local, gives quick overview about top corps/alliances (by player count) and recent kill stats.

Scan
----

Not implemented yet, but should be able to analyze D-scans how I want it done

Shopping Lists
--------------

Not implemented yet, but I want a shopping list


IGB Notes
---------

* ScalaJS works if you include es5-shim and es5-sham
* classList does not work, use setAttribute
